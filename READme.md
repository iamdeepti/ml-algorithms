# ml-algorithms
This repository will feature popular ML algorithms written from scratch

The libraries used for this repository are:
1) Numpy - for scientific and vector computation in python
2) os - for manipulating directory paths
3) matplotlib - to plot data
4) pandas - to read and manipulate.csv files
5) mpl_toolkits.mplot3d - to plot 3d plots

# Files :
Analysis_of_appleStore.ipynb : Analysis of data from apple_Store.csv using the above libraries.

# DataSets:
Apple_Store.csv : contains data of ios app (but unfortunately it doesn't include no. of downloads, so I won't be using this dataset any further)

I have included required comments so that a newbie in python having basic programming knowledge can understand
